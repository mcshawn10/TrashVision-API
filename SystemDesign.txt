few components of this project:
- CV model
- (Kafka?) publisher/subscriber -> will send count to web as camera captures data
- simple website to display results
- database to store results

everything in python for now, eventually will need to port to C++ for realtime processing


A very basic model has been created, definitely needs to be fine-tuned 
Nonetheless: 
- get opencv working, and deploy your model onto the frames that are captured,
- if a trash is detected, then log a count to a database


database needs to be setup
use kafka to publish the data to the database
